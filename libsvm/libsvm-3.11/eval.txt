Download eval.cpp, eval.h, and Makefile, and put them to the directory of LIBSVM (overwrite the old Makefile).
Add

	#include "eval.h"

to svm-train.c and svm-predict.c.
Replace

	do_cross_validation();

in the main() of svm-train.c with

	double cv =  binary_class_cross_validation(&prob, &param, nr_fold);
	printf("Cross Validation = %g%%\n",100.0*cv);

Note that the percentage mark is necessary in order to use grid.py. No need to change other places where do_cross_validation() appears.
Replace

	predict(input,output);

in main() of svm-predict.c with

	binary_class_predict(input, output);

Assign the global variable

	double (*validation_function)(const dvec_t&, const ivec_t&) = auc;

in eval.cpp to the evaluation function you preferred. You can also assign precision, recall, fscore, or bac here.
